#+TITLE:Dark Atoll: Warm Coral Theme For Reading

I'm a happy user of dark themes for more than [[https://github.com/aartaka/laconia-theme][three years now]]. I made a theme for [[https://aartaka.me][my website]] and [[https://github.com/aartaka/st][Suckless terminal]] in soft coral colors and decided that it's pretty enough to use everywhere. This repo documents my color choices so that I can reproduce the theme later in whatever software I use. Here are the colors:

| Role       | Color     | Bright variant |
| Background | ~#000000~ | ~#090000~      |
| Foreground | ~#ffefd5~ | ~#fff8f8~      |
| Red        | ~#cd5c5c~ | ~#fa8072~      |
| Green      | ~#556b2f~ | ~#6b8e23~      |
| Yellow     | ~#ffa408~ | ~#ffb82b~      |
| Blue       | ~#3457d5~ | ~#1f75fe~      |
| Purple     | ~#6f00ff~ | ~#8a2be2~      |
| Light Blue | ~#87d3f8~ | ~#afdbf5~      |
| White      | ~#ffefd5~ | ~#fff8f8~      |

And here's how it looks when used. In ST:
