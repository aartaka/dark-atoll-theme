#+TITLE:Dark Atoll: Warm Coral Theme For Reading

I'm a happy user of dark themes for more than [[https://github.com/aartaka/laconia-theme][three years now]]. I made a theme for [[https://aartaka.me][my website]] and [[https://github.com/aartaka/st][Suckless terminal]] in soft coral colors and decided that it's pretty enough to use everywhere. This repo documents my color choices so that I can reproduce the theme later in whatever software I use. Here are the colors:

| Role             | Color                  | Bright variant           |
| Background/Black | ~#000000~ (black)      | ~#090000~-~#550000~       |
| Foreground/White | ~#ffefd5~              | ~#fff8f8~                |
| Accent/Red       | ~#cd5c5c~ (indian red) | ~#f08080~ (lightcoral)   |
| Green            | ~#556b2f~              | ~#8bae53~ (olive drab)    |
| Yellow           | ~#ffa408~              | ~#ffb82b~                |
| Blue             | ~#3457d5~              | ~#1f75fe~ (blue crayola) |
| Purple           | ~#6f00ff~              | ~#aa4bf2~                 |
| Light Blue       | ~#87d3f8~ (pale azure) | ~#afdbf5~ (uranian blue) |

I also often use maroon all over the place (particularly on my
website), but that's usually a light theme thing.

And here's how it looks when used. In ST:
